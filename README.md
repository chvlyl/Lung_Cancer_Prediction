# Lung Cancer Prediction

## Goal
Predict lung cancer based on CT images

## Data
1. Data Science Bowl 2017
Data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017). All images are in DICOM format, which can be visualized in 3DSlicer. This competition had two phases (stage1 and stage2). Total 471,537 images from 2,101 patients were included in this dataset. The table below gives detailed numbers.

Those images are high-resolution lung CT scans provided by the National Cancer Institute. The orignal paper was published in NEJM 2011 [Reduced Lung-Cancer Mortality with Low-Dose Computed Tomographic Screening](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1102873). The goal of the original study was to use low-dose CT screening as a way to reduce lung cancer mortality.
